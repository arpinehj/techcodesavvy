                    <p class="mt-5">After completing three courses with Code First Girls, I wanted to pursue a career in tech so I applied for
                      a CFGDegree (at the time it was called Nanodegree). It had two pathways (Software or Data). I chose Software
                      Engineering pathway because I enjoyed Python and wanted to create a website using Python as a project.
                      <br><br>
                      CFGDegree is a 14-week bootcamp in either data, software or full-stack. It is "open by application and interview to high potential 
                      women who want to pursue a career in data, software, or as a full-stack developer with [their] partner companies."
                      <br><br>
                      It has seven-week foundation layer followed by six weeks in specialisation area. 
                      After the seven-week foundation layer, candidates have a break to catch up or relax.
                      During specialisation weeks, students work on group projects which needs to be presented by the end of the course and published on GitHub.
                      <br><br>
                      It is 100% free.

                    <h5><b>Final Project</b></h5>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p class="col-md-7">My team and I decided to create a Flask website which is a Python web framework that makes it easier to create web applications in Python. 
                          We created user login and movie recommendation using Python, HTML and CSS. I was the only one in the team that created the front end which I had a lot of fun 
                          teaching my team and inspired me to apply to be a CFG instructor. The main idea of the app FilmNow is for the user to enter a movie title of their choice and 
                          the application will take that and return both the information on that movie and three recommendations based on it. The website retrieves movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) 
                          which is an open source, community built database for TV and film. This means that the database is updated daily and the users can enjoy up to date information on movies 
                          they have an interest in. 
                          <br><br>
                          Each week, one of the team members is a scrum master. Everyday we had a 15-minute daily scrum to review our progress and plan our aims and objectives for the day.
                           This was helpful because it allowed me to work in an agile environment. As a team, we created a workspace on Trello to record our development process. The workspace allowed us 
                           to allocate tasks, plan, upload (attach) resources, and check on our progress. 
                          <br><br>
                          We had a lot of challenges while creating this project including using Git and becoming familiar with a new framework. We were given a list of topics to choose. The project 
                          is based on entertainment because as a team we had a common interest in the topic and wanted to create a project that is targeted to everyone. If we had more time, we would have add more functionalities 
                          such as allowing the user to change their email and password using a dashboard and creating a chatbot to help the user navigate the website. The project is based on the criteria given by the instructors.
                          <br><br>
                          For our project we adopted some agile methodology elements as we wanted to be in constant collaboration during the development stages. As well as continuously messaging on our Slack group chat, 
                          we held daily standup meetings everyday at 11am and sometimes these turned into scrum meetings to discuss our progress in much more detail. Due to people’s different commitments and schedules, there were 
                          times when we could not have the whole team available in the meetings. To ensure everyone was kept in the loop in regard to our progress, we shared summarising notes in our Slack group chat. 
                          <br><br>
                          Using Git to work collaboratively proved to be one of our biggest challenges. It was important to learn how to Git for a tech job. Within the first two weeks of the project we were finding it difficult to 
                          coordinate branches and work within them, this meant there was confusion with pull requests and it became hard to track branches and files. In addition, we were constantly finding ourselves creating new repositories 
                          which added further confusion. As a result, our collaboration was affected as not only could we not work on separate tasks independently, we were left with one person having the most recent files on their machine which 
                          left us only with the option of having that person do all the coding during the 11am Google Meets.
                          <br><br>
                          While working on the project, I learnt how to work in agile environment, created a Flask project and tried to use Git/GitHub. I worked with the team well and constantly communicated with them on Slack and GoogleMeet. 
                          I also had a lot of fun despite many obstacles as I showed great dedication and was willing to learn new skills to ensure that FilmNow met and exceeded the standards we had set for our project.

        <p>This blog is about my experience with Code First Girls after completing all three courses:
          Web Development, Python and SQL.
          I hope this will inspire young female/non-binary individuals to apply the courses
          and lead them to get a career in tech.
          It is time to close the gender gap in tech and get more girls into the field.
